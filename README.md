# Sophis

Welcome to my philosophers app! This project was developed with the primary goal of implementing a clean architecture and creating unit tests.

## Overview

This simple app allows you to explore the history of various renowned philosophers and also offers the unique functionality of interacting with them. You can read their stories, ask them questions directly using the chatGPT API, and save their responses on the device's local storage.
